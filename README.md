# OSHA-Sort
A labor law compliant sorting algorithm

How it works:
    The base sorting method is a good old insertion sort, but in compliance with modern labor laws
		For every index that data is moved, the computer will take a 1 second break.
		Ex. Index 5 -> Index 3, the computer will take a 2 second break.
		In addition to the quick breaks that the computer autimatically takes, there is also a small chance
		that when the computer clocks into its shift, will will start a 30 minute break as is allowed in
		labor laws
